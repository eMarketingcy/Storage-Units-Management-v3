# Verification Report - Payment System Fixes

## âœ… ALL FIXES APPLIED

### What Was Fixed:

1. **Period Extension**: Now works for Units, Pallets, and Customers
2. **Payment History**: Now records ALL payment types (not just customers)
3. **Items Display**: Shows unit/pallet names (not N/A)
4. **Receipt**: Gets fresh data after extension
5. **Logging**: Comprehensive error logs added

---

## How to Verify It's Working

### Check the Error Logs:

```bash
tail -f wp-content/debug.log | grep "SUM Payment"
```

### After Payment You Should See:

```
SUM Payment Processing: entity_id=12, is_customer=no, payment_months=6
SUM Payment: Advance payment detected - extending periods by 6 months
SUM Payment SUCCESS: Extended unit 12 from 2025-10-03 to 2026-04-03
SUM Payment History: Recording payment - customer: XSsadsd, items: 1
```

### If You See ERROR:

```
SUM Payment ERROR: Unit 12 not found or has no period_until
SUM Payment ERROR: Failed to extend unit 12 - [database error]
```

This tells us EXACTLY what went wrong!

## Test Payment:

1. Find any unpaid unit
2. Note current "UNTIL" date
3. Pay for 6 months
4. Check logs (above command)
5. Refresh admin - date should be extended
6. Check Payment History page
7. Items should show unit name (not N/A!)

---

## Database Verification:

```sql
-- Check if unit was extended
SELECT id, unit_name, period_until, payment_status
FROM wp_storage_units
WHERE id = 12;

-- Check payment history
SELECT customer_name, amount, payment_months, items_paid
FROM wp_storage_payment_history
ORDER BY payment_date DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

The logs will show us exactly what's happening!
