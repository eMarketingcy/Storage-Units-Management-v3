## üîç Troubleshooting Guide

### If You See: "SUM Payment ERROR: Security check failed"
**Cause:** Nonce validation failed
**Fix:** Refresh the payment page and try again

---

### If You See: "SUM Payment ERROR: Missing data - stripe_token"
**Cause:** Stripe token not generated
**Fix:** 
1. Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
2. Verify Stripe publishable key is set in settings
3. Make sure card details are valid

---

### If You See: "Invalid payment token"
**Cause:** Payment token doesn't match
**Fix:** 
1. Check that `payment_token` is being sent from frontend
2. Verify token is stored in database/transient
3. Try regenerating the invoice

---

### If You Don't See ANY Logs
**Causes:**
1. AJAX request not reaching the server
2. Action name mismatch
3. WordPress AJAX not working

**Debug:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Filter by "admin-ajax"
4. Try payment again
5. Look for the request
6. Check:
   - Status code (should be 200)
   - Response (should be JSON)
   - POST data contains: `action=sum_process_stripe_payment`

---

### If Response Shows HTML Instead of JSON
**Causes:**
1. PHP error before JSON output
2. Theme/plugin outputting HTML
3. WordPress debug notices

**Check:**
1. Look at the HTML response in Network tab
2. Check if there's a PHP error message
3. Look for error log entries
