# Payment System - Testing Guide

## ✅ FINAL FIX APPLIED - Output Buffer Cleaning

### The Problem:
When WordPress debug mode was enabled, HTML output (debug notices, warnings) was being sent BEFORE the JSON response, causing:
```
Payment failed: Unexpected token '<', "<div id="e"... is not valid JSON
```

### The Solution:
Added **output buffer cleaning** to ensure ONLY clean JSON is sent:

1. **Start output buffering** at function entry to catch any stray output
2. **Clean buffer** before sending ANY JSON response (success or error)
3. **Helper methods** that guarantee clean JSON:
   - `send_json_error()` - Cleans buffer then sends error
   - `send_json_success()` - Cleans buffer then sends success

**File:** `includes/class-payment-handler.php`

## 🐛 Debug Mode Safe

**Now works with WordPress debug mode enabled!**

Even if debug notices, warnings, or errors are triggered:
- Output buffer catches them
- Buffer is cleaned before JSON response
- Frontend receives clean JSON

## 📋 Verify Payment Works:

### Check Database:
```sql
SELECT id, unit_name, period_until, payment_status
FROM wpat_storage_units
WHERE id = 12;
```

**Expected:**
- period_until: 2026-04-03 (extended!)
- payment_status: paid

### Check Payment History:
**WordPress Admin → Storage Units → Payment History**

Should show:
- Transaction ID
- Customer name (not N/A)
- Items: Unit B12 (not N/A)
- Amount: EUR 1,820.70
- Date: Today
