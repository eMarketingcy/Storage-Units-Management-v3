# Advance Payment System - All Issues Fixed

## Problems Reported & Solutions

### ‚úÖ 1. Period Extension Not Working Correctly

**Problem:** Unit (31 Oct) and Pallet (30 Oct) weren't extending properly after 6-month payment

**Root Cause:** Code was finding the LATEST date and extending all items to the same date

**Solution:** Changed to extend EACH item individually from its OWN date

**File:** `includes/class-billing-automation.php` (lines 337-380)

```php
// OLD (WRONG): All items extended to same date
$new_until = latest_date + 6 months;
foreach ($units as $unit) {
    UPDATE unit to $new_until;  // All get same date
}

// NEW (CORRECT): Each item extended individually
foreach ($units as $unit) {
    $new_until = $unit->period_until + 6 months;
    UPDATE unit to $new_until;  // Each keeps its own date + 6 months
}
```

**Result:**
- Unit (31 Oct 2025) + 6 months = **30 Apr 2026** ‚úì
- Pallet (30 Oct 2025) + 6 months = **30 Apr 2026** ‚úì

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Receipt "Paid Until" Shows "‚Äî"

**Problem:** Receipt showed "Paid Until: ‚Äî" instead of actual date

**Root Cause:** Code was adding months TWICE:
1. First in database update (period_until + 6 months)
2. Then again in receipt (already_updated_date + 6 months)

**Solution:** Display the actual period_until from database (already updated)

**Files:**
- Email: `includes/class-payment-handler.php` (lines 647-666)
- PDF: `includes/class-payment-handler.php` (lines 913-930)

```php
// OLD (WRONG): Adding months twice
$new_date = $rental['period_until'] + $payment_months;  // WRONG!

// NEW (CORRECT): Just display the updated date
$paid_until = $rental['period_until'];  // Already updated in database
```

**Result:** Receipt now shows:
```
üìÖ Advance Payment Confirmation
Payment Period: 6 month(s)
Items Paid Until:
‚Ä¢ Unit 5: April 30, 2026 ‚úì
‚Ä¢ Pallet 2: April 30, 2026 ‚úì
```

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Receipt Filename Wrong

**Problem:** Filename was "receipt-unit-5-..." even when paying for unit + pallet

**Solution:** Generate filename with ALL items paid

**File:** `includes/class-payment-handler.php` (lines 728-735)

```php
// NEW: Include all items in filename
$filename_items = [];
foreach ($rentals as $rental) {
    $filename_items[] = strtolower($rental['type']) . $rental['name'];
}
$pdf_filename = 'receipt-' . implode('-', $filename_items) . '-2025-10-01.pdf';
```

**Examples:**
- Single: `receipt-unit5-2025-10-01-10-00-28.pdf`
- Multiple: `receipt-unit5-pallet2-2025-10-01-10-00-28.pdf`

### ‚úÖ 4. Payment History Tracking (NEW FEATURE)

**Problem:** No way to track what was paid in each transaction

**Solution:** Created complete payment history system

**New File:** `includes/class-payment-history.php`

**Database Table:** `wp_storage_payment_history`

**What's Stored:**
```sql
id, customer_id, customer_name, transaction_id,
amount, currency, payment_months,
items_paid (JSON), payment_date
```

**items_paid JSON Example:**
```json
[
    {"type": "unit", "name": "5", "period_until": "2026-04-30", "monthly_price": "150.00"},
    {"type": "pallet", "name": "2", "period_until": "2026-04-30", "monthly_price": "153.45"}
]
```

**Usage:**
```php
$history = new SUM_Payment_History();

// Get customer payments
$payments = $history->get_customer_payments($customer_id);

// Get specific transaction
$payment = $history->get_payment_by_transaction($customer_id, $transaction_id);

// Get revenue report
$revenue = $history->get_revenue_by_date_range('2025-01-01', '2025-12-31');
```

**Integration:** Automatically called after every successful payment

---

### ‚úÖ 5. Billing Settings Page Error

**Problem:**
```
Fatal error: Call to undefined method SUM_Database::update_setting()
```

**Solution:** Changed to correct method name `save_setting()`

**File:** `templates/billing-settings-page.php` (lines 18-22)

---

## Complete Payment Flow (Fixed)

### Step 1: Customer Pays 6 Months in Advance

```
Customer: XSsadsd
Unit 5: Currently paid until 31 Oct 2025
Pallet 2: Currently paid until 30 Oct 2025
Payment: 6 months √ó ‚Ç¨303.45 = ‚Ç¨1,820.70
```

### Step 2: Backend Processing

```php
// 1. Stripe payment confirmed
$transaction_id = "ch_3SDK1XBJCxRc2cUi0TcwjwqC";

// 2. Extend each item INDIVIDUALLY
Unit 5: 2025-10-31 + 6 months ‚Üí 2026-04-30
Pallet 2: 2025-10-30 + 6 months ‚Üí 2026-04-30

UPDATE storage_units
SET period_until = '2026-04-30', payment_status = 'paid'
WHERE id = 5;

UPDATE storage_pallets
SET period_until = '2026-04-30', payment_status = 'paid'
WHERE id = 2;

// 3. Record in payment history
INSERT INTO payment_history (
    customer_id = 123,
    transaction_id = "ch_3SDK...",
    amount = 1820.70,
    payment_months = 6,
    items_paid = '[{"type":"unit","name":"5",...}, {"type":"pallet","name":"2",...}]'
);

// 4. Get FRESH data (with updated dates)
$rentals = get_customer_rentals(123);
// Returns:
// [
//   {type: 'unit', name: '5', period_until: '2026-04-30'},
//   {type: 'pallet', name: '2', period_until: '2026-04-30'}
// ]

// 5. Generate receipt
$filename = 'receipt-unit5-pallet2-2025-10-01-10-00-28.pdf';

PDF Content:
  Payment Period: 6 month(s)
  Items Paid Until:
  ‚Ä¢ Unit 5: April 30, 2026  ‚Üê From database
