## üìã Completed Features

### 1. ‚úÖ Billing Settings Admin Page
**Location:** WordPress Admin ‚Üí Storage Units ‚Üí Billing Automation

**Features:**
- Toggle to enable/disable automated billing
- Configure invoice generation timing (days before period ends)
- Configure first reminder timing (days after invoice)
- Configure final reminder timing (days before due date)
- Option to restrict automated billing to Customers only

**Default Settings:**
- Invoice generation: 0 days before period end (on the day)
- First reminder: 7 days after invoice generation
- Final reminder: 2 days before due date
- Customers only: Enabled

### 2. ‚úÖ Automated Invoice Generation
**How It Works:**
- Daily cron job runs at midnight
- Checks all customer rentals with upcoming `period_until` dates
- Generates invoices X days before period expires
- Example: If unit paid until 15/10/2025, generates invoice for period 15/10/2025 - 14/11/2025
- **Only sends to Customers** - Units and Pallets remain manual

**Email Content:**
- Professional branded invoice email
- Lists all unpaid items (units and pallets)
- Total amount due
- Direct payment link
- Company contact information

### 3. ‚úÖ Automated Reminder System
**First Reminder (Default: 7 days after invoice)**
- Sent if payment status is still 'unpaid'
- Friendly tone with payment link
- Lists outstanding items
- Prevents duplicate reminders using transients

**Final Reminder (Default: 2 days before due)**
- Marked as URGENT
- Warning about impending due date
- Highlighted payment button
- Example: If due 14/11/2025, reminder sent 12/11/2025

**Smart Features:**
- Transient-based tracking prevents duplicate emails
- Respects customer payment status

### 4. ‚úÖ Advance Payment Options

- Select "12 months"
- Total: EUR 571.20
- Period extends from 14/11/2025 to 14/11/2026

### 5. ‚úÖ Automatic Period Extension
**Backend Processing:**
- When advance payment is completed
- System automatically extends `period_until` for ALL customer rentals
- Updates both units and pallets
- Changes payment_status to 'paid'
- Logs extension to error log

**Example:**
- Customer has 2 units paid until 15/10/2025
- Pays for 12 months
- Both units automatically extended to 15/10/2026

## üìù Important Notes

1. **Cron Jobs:**
   - WordPress cron requires site visits to trigger
   - For production, use system cron:
   ```bash
   */15 * * * * wget -q -O - https://yoursite.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron
   ```

2. **Email Delivery:**
   - Test with real email addresses
   - Consider SMTP plugin for reliability
   - Check spam folders during testing

3. **Logging:**
   - All billing actions logged to error log
   - Enable debugging in wp-config.php:
   ```php
   define('WP_DEBUG', true);
   define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
   define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);
   ```

4. **Security:**
   - Payment tokens rotate after each successful payment
   - Transients prevent duplicate reminders
   - Nonce verification on all AJAX requests

5. **Customer vs Units/Pallets:**
   - Automated billing: Customers ONLY
   - Manual invoices: Units & Pallets available
   - Advance payments: Customers ONLY
