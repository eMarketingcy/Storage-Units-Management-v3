## üîç Troubleshooting:

### If You See: "Validation passed" But Nothing After
**Problem:** Stripe API call failing
**Check:**
- Stripe secret key is correct
- Stripe test mode is enabled
- Network can reach Stripe API

---

### If You See: "Stripe charge SUCCESS" But No "Database updates"
**Problem:** Code execution stopped after Stripe charge
**Check:**
- PHP errors in the log
- Memory limit issues
- Fatal errors

---

### If You See: "Database update failed"
**Problem:** Update query failed
**Check:**
- Database connection
- Table exists: `wpat_storage_units`
- User has UPDATE permissions

### If You See: "Extended unit 12" But Still Shows Old Date
**Problem:** Database was updated but not reflected
**Check Database:**
```sql
SELECT id, unit_name, period_until, payment_status
FROM wpat_storage_units
WHERE id = 12;
```

If database shows NEW date but admin shows OLD date:
- Clear WordPress cache
- Clear browser cache
- Refresh the page

---

### If You See: "History recorded - result=failed"
**Problem:** Payment history table insert failed
**Check:**
- Table exists: `wpat_payment_history`
- Check table structure
- Check foreign key constraints

---
