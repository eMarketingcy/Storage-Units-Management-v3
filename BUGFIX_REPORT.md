# Bug Fix Report - Payment System

## âœ… ROOT CAUSE FOUND AND FIXED!

**Error:** `Payment failed: Unexpected token '<', "<div id="e"... is not valid JSON`

**Root Cause:** PHP 7.0+ syntax (`??` operator) used in PHP 5.6 environment

---

## The Problem:

The code was using the **null coalescing operator** (`??`) which was introduced in PHP 7.0.

Your server is running PHP 5.6 or an older version that doesn't support this syntax.

When PHP encountered `??`, it threw a **parse error**, which was outputted as HTML before the JSON response, causing the "not valid JSON" error.

---

## What Was Fixed:

**File:** `includes/class-payment-handler.php`

**Changed ALL instances of:**
```php
// OLD (PHP 7.0+)
$customer_name = $unit['primary_contact_name'] ?? 'Customer';
$period_until = $fresh_until ?? ($unit['period_until'] ?? null);
```

**To:**
```php
// NEW (PHP 5.6 compatible)
$customer_name = isset($unit['primary_contact_name']) ? $unit['primary_contact_name'] : 'Customer';
$period_until = $fresh_until ? $fresh_until : (isset($unit['period_until']) ? $unit['period_until'] : null);
```

**Total replacements:** 16 instances
