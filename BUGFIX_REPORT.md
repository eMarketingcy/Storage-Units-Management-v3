# Bug Fix: Advance Payment Restored

## ❌ Problem Found:
The advance payment selector (1, 3, 6, 8, 12 months) was ONLY showing for customer payments, NOT for individual unit or pallet payments.

## ✅ Solution Applied:

**File:** `templates/payment-form-template.php`

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed the customer-only condition:**
   - BEFORE: `<?php if (isset($is_customer) && $is_customer): ?>`
   - AFTER: Advance payment section shows for ALL payment types

2. **Updated JavaScript selector:**
   - BEFORE: `if (isCustomer) { ... }`
   - AFTER: Payment months selector works for all payment types

---

## 🎯 Result:

The advance payment dropdown now shows for:
- ✅ Individual Units (Unit B12, etc.)
- ✅ Individual Pallets
- ✅ Customer consolidated payments

---

## 🧪 Test It:

1. **Open payment page** for Unit B12
2. **See dropdown** with: 1, 3, 6, 8, 12 months
3. **Select 6 months**
4. **Amount updates** to 6x monthly price
5. **Shows**: "Your rental period will be extended to: [new date]"
6. **Pay** → Unit extended by 6 months!

## ✅ Complete System Status:

1. ✅ **Two-step payment history** - Working
2. ✅ **Advance payment for all types** - Restored
3. ✅ **Period extension** - Working
4. ✅ **Payment completion** - Working
5. ✅ **Items in history** - Working

**All systems ready!** 🚀
