# Bug Fix Report - Unit Payments Not Working

## Problems You Reported

### 1. Unit B12 Date Didn't Change
- Paid €1,820.70 for 6 months
- Unit still shows "UNTIL: 03 Oct 2025"
- Should show "UNTIL: 03 Apr 2026"

### 2. Receipt Missing Details
- No items shown in PDF
- No "Paid Until" dates
- No advance payment info

### 3. Payment History Not Visible
- Can't see payment records anywhere in admin

---

## Root Causes

### Bug #1: Period Extension Only for Customers
**Location:** `includes/class-payment-handler.php:496`

```php
// WRONG CODE
if ($payment_months > 1 && $is_customer) {  // ← Only customers!
    extend_periods();
}
```

**Problem:** Unit B12 was paid directly (not through customer account), so period wasn't extended.

### Bug #2: Receipt Used Old Data
**Location:** `includes/class-payment-handler.php:637-649`

Receipt fetched unit data before extension completed, so showed old dates.

### Bug #3: No Admin Page
No interface to view payment history even though data was being saved.

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### FIX 1: Period Extension for Units & Pallets

**Now extends ALL payment types:**
- Customer payments → All their units/pallets
- Unit payment → That specific unit
- Pallet payment → That specific pallet

**Code added (lines 495-535):**
```php
if ($payment_months > 1) {
    if ($is_customer) {
        // Extend all customer units/pallets
    } elseif ($is_pallet) {
        // Extend this pallet
        $new_until = current_date + payment_months;
        UPDATE pallets SET period_until = $new_until;
    } else {
        // Extend this unit
        $new_until = current_date + payment_months;
        UPDATE units SET period_until = $new_until;
    }
}
```

### FIX 2: Receipt Gets Fresh Data

**Added fresh database query after extension:**
```php
// Clear cache
wp_cache_delete($entity_id, 'storage_units');

// Get FRESH period_until
$fresh_period_until = SELECT period_until FROM units WHERE id = X;

// Use in receipt
$rentals = [['period_until' => $fresh_period_until]];
```

### FIX 3: Payment History Admin Page

**New admin page:** Storage Units → Payment History

**Features:**
- Total revenue dashboard
- Filter by date/customer
- View all transactions
- Click "View Details" for full info
